## TDD Pipeline

The standard flow for every feature:

```
/plan <task>        →  Planner produces blueprint     →  🟡 Planned
                          ↓
/test <task> red    →  Tester writes failing tests     →  🟥 Tests RED
                          ↓
/develop <plan>     →  Developer implements code        →  🟠 In Development
                          ↓
/test <task> green  →  Tester confirms tests pass       →  🟩 Tests GREEN
                          ↓
/validate <task>    →  Validator audits                 →  🟢 Validated
                          ↓
merge to main       →  Orchestrator merges              →  ✅ Done
```

> **TDD Rule:** No code is written before a failing test describes it. No feature is complete until a passing test proves it.

## Agent Activity Log

<!-- Newest entries at the top -->

| Date | Agent | Action | Details |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 2026-05-16 | Validator | Audited Phase 3A — 🟢 PASS WITH CONDITIONS | 84 tests, 135 assertions. All 44 ACs met (AC-3A-01 through AC-3A-44). BR-02 (partial), BR-03, BR-04 fully enforced. ADR-005 D1–D5 all verified. 1 Medium finding: M-01 duplicate warning badges in close-review.blade.php (cosmetic, non-blocking). Payout formula BCMath-verified with manual trace. Revenue negative case verified. No float arithmetic. No security issues. No regressions. Audit: `docs/audits/phase-3a-shift-close-payout-calculation-audit.md`. Approved for merge. |
| 2026-05-16 | Developer | Tests GREEN — Phase 3A implementation complete | 84 tests pass (35 unit + 49 feature). 688 total suite, 0 regressions. Files created: `app/Services/ShiftCloseService.php`, `app/Http/Requests/ConfirmCloseShiftRequest.php`, `resources/views/shifts/close-review.blade.php`, `database/migrations/2026_05_16_172157_add_revenue_to_payments_table.php`. Files modified: `app/Models/Payment.php` (revenue fillable + cast), `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ShiftController.php` (reviewClose + confirmClose + AuthorizesRequests), `app/Policies/ShiftPolicy.php` (reviewClose), `routes/web.php` (close.review route, confirmClose mapping), `resources/views/shifts/show.blade.php` (link to review page), `resources/views/shifts/partials/biker-assignments.blade.php` (payment columns for closed shifts), `tests/Feature/Controllers/ShiftControllerTest.php` (4 tests updated to pass confirmed=1). Next: Validator audits. |
| 2026-05-16 | Tester | Tests RED — 71 failing tests written for Phase 3A | 2 test files: `tests/Unit/Services/ShiftCloseServiceTest.php` (35 unit tests) and `tests/Feature/Controllers/ShiftCloseControllerTest.php` (49 feature tests — 36 fail + 13 pass with existing code). All 71 new tests fail as expected (TDD RED). 617 existing tests still green (0 regressions). Covers AC-3A-01 through AC-3A-44. Failure reasons: `ShiftCloseService` class not found, `shifts.close.review` route not defined, `ShiftPolicy@reviewClose` not defined, `ConfirmCloseShiftRequest` not enforcing `confirmed` field, no Payment row creation on close, `payments.revenue` column not yet added. Next: Developer implements to make tests pass. |
| 2026-05-16 | Planner | Produced Phase 3A blueprint | Plan at `docs/plans/phase-3a-shift-close-payout-calculation.md`. Covers: two-step close flow (GET review → POST confirm), ShiftCloseService for batch payout calculation, Payment row creation per shift_biker, revenue column on payments, biker eligibility warnings (no User account / no verified PIX key). 44 acceptance criteria (AC-3A-01 through AC-3A-44). Refs ADR-005 D1–D5. Schema: add `revenue DECIMAL(12,2)` to payments table. New files: ShiftCloseService, ConfirmCloseShiftRequest, close-review Blade view, 2 test files. Modified: ShiftController (split close → reviewClose + confirmClose), routes, CloseShiftRequest, Payment model, shifts/show view, ShiftPolicy. Complexity: Complex. Next: Tester writes RED tests. |
| 2026-05-15 | Manual (Product Owner) | Resolved 5 Phase 3 prerequisite decisions — ADR-005 | (1) Admin-only close, payout post-close. (2) Financial rates snapshotted at assignment. (3) Inactive bikers blocked from new assignments, existing preserved. (4) Bikers must have User accounts to be paid. (5) Admin confirms no contested trips before closing. ADR-005 created at `docs/adr/005-phase3-prerequisite-decisions.md`. |
| 2026-05-15 | Tracker | Updated progress for Phase 2E — End-of-Shift Entry | Pipeline complete — 🟢 Validated.

BR-01 enforced at 3 layers (model boot hook, SubmitTripsRequest withValidator, ShiftPolicy). No new migrations. Phase 2D also validated (57 tests). All existing 543+ tests pass. Next: Phase 3 — Payout Engine. |
| 2026-05-15 | Tracker | Updated progress for Phase 2D — Live Tick Tracking | Planner produced blueprint at `docs/plans/phase-2d-live-tick-tracking.md`. Tester wrote 57 failing tests at `tests/Feature/Controllers/ShiftTrackingControllerTest.php` (all RED — TDD RED phase). Covers AC-2D-01 through AC-2D-32: routes, authorization, BR-01 enforcement (live_tick workflow guard), tick execution, dashboard view, navigation. No new migrations. Next: Developer implements ShiftTrackingController, TickTripRequest, Blade view, routes. All 482 existing tests must remain green. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Finalized Phase 2C pipeline — created ADR-004 | Created `docs/adr/004-shift-biker-assignment.md` (Shift-Biker Assignment). Updated ADR index. Phase 2C: 🟢 Validated. Deliverables: ShiftBikerController (4 actions), AssignBikerRequest, UpdateShiftBikerRequest, nested routes, Blade partial. BR-01 enforced at 2 layers, BR-05 at 3 layers. 47 test methods, all existing 407+ tests still green. No new migrations. Next: Phase 3 — Payout Engine. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Finalized Phase 2B pipeline — created ADR-003 | Created `docs/adr/003-shift-crud-lifecycle.md` (Shift CRUD & Lifecycle). Updated ADR index (ADR-003, ADR-004 reserved). Phase 2B: 🟢 Validated* with 4 known findings (M-01 dashboard nav gap, M-02 numeric vs decimal:0,2, L-01 English text, L-02 Blade inline query). 74 tests, 407 total suite, 0 regressions. Next: Phase 3 — Payout Engine. |

Audit: `docs/audits/phase-2b-shift-crud-lifecycle-audit.md`. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Updated progress for Phase 2A — Auth & Roles | Phase-2A status: 🟢 Validated. Created ADR-002 (`docs/adr/002-auth-roles-magic-link.md`). Updated ADR index. Added User/UserRole/Policy entities to Core Entities table. Updated BR-05 to 🟢 Validated. Updated Auth infrastructure to 🟢 Validated. Added Phase-2A row to Phase Overview. 5 new test files, 46 ACs covered. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker (manual) | Created ADR mechanism + ADR-001 | Created `docs/adr/` with README index, TEMPLATE.md, and ADR-001 (core payout schema). Updated tracker skill to automate ADR creation on future pipelines. Archived pipeline manifest to `docs/archives/pipelines/`. Added ADR cross-references to Shift model, ShiftStatus/PaymentStatus enums, plan file, and audit report. |
| 2026-05-14 | Validator | Audited Phase-1 Core Schema — 🟢 PASS WITH CONDITIONS → fixed | 205 tests, 365 assertions. All 41 ACs met. 3 findings: (1) Restaurant `$guarded = []` removed — fixed, (2) AC numbering collision in plan — cosmetic, (3) plan scope says 6 enums but only 5 exist — cosmetic.
