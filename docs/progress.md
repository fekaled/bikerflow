## TDD Pipeline

The standard flow for every feature:

```
/plan <task>        →  Planner produces blueprint     →  🟡 Planned
                          ↓
/test <task> red    →  Tester writes failing tests     →  🟥 Tests RED
                          ↓
/develop <plan>     →  Developer implements code        →  🟠 In Development
                          ↓
/test <task> green  →  Tester confirms tests pass       →  🟩 Tests GREEN
                          ↓
/validate <task>    →  Validator audits                 →  🟢 Validated
                          ↓
merge to main       →  Orchestrator merges              →  ✅ Done
```

> **TDD Rule:** No code is written before a failing test describes it. No feature is complete until a passing test proves it.

## Agent Activity Log

<!-- Newest entries at the top -->

|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Finalized Phase 2B pipeline — created ADR-003 | Created `docs/adr/003-shift-crud-lifecycle.md` (Shift CRUD & Lifecycle). Updated ADR index (ADR-003, ADR-004 reserved). Phase 2B: 🟢 Validated* with 4 known findings (M-01 dashboard nav gap, M-02 numeric vs decimal:0,2, L-01 English text, L-02 Blade inline query). 74 tests, 407 total suite, 0 regressions. Next: Phase 3 — Payout Engine. |
| 2026-05-14 | Validator | Audited Phase 2B Shift CRUD & Lifecycle — 🟢 PASS WITH CONDITIONS | 74 tests, 134 assertions. All 47 ACs met. BR-01 enforced at 3 layers. BR-05 enforced at 2 layers. 4 findings: M-01 dashboard missing Turnos link, M-02 validation rule deviation (numeric vs decimal:0,2), L-01 English text in PT-BR UI, L-02 inline User::find in Blade. Audit: `docs/audits/phase-2b-shift-crud-lifecycle-audit.md`. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Updated progress for Phase 2A — Auth & Roles | Phase-2A status: 🟢 Validated. Created ADR-002 (`docs/adr/002-auth-roles-magic-link.md`). Updated ADR index. Added User/UserRole/Policy entities to Core Entities table. Updated BR-05 to 🟢 Validated. Updated Auth infrastructure to 🟢 Validated. Added Phase-2A row to Phase Overview. 5 new test files, 46 ACs covered. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker (manual) | Created ADR mechanism + ADR-001 | Created `docs/adr/` with README index, TEMPLATE.md, and ADR-001 (core payout schema). Updated tracker skill to automate ADR creation on future pipelines. Archived pipeline manifest to `docs/archives/pipelines/`. Added ADR cross-references to Shift model, ShiftStatus/PaymentStatus enums, plan file, and audit report. |
| 2026-05-14 | Validator | Audited Phase-1 Core Schema — 🟢 PASS WITH CONDITIONS → fixed | 205 tests, 365 assertions. All 41 ACs met. 3 findings: (1) Restaurant `$guarded = []` removed — fixed, (2) AC numbering collision in plan — cosmetic, (3) plan scope says 6 enums but only 5 exist — cosmetic. Audit: `docs/audits/phase-1-core-schema-audit.md`. Verdict: PASS after fix. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Updated progress board | Phase-1 Core Schema status: 🟢 Validated. All 7 entities validated. BR-01, BR-03, BR-06 fully enforced. BR-02, BR-04, BR-05 partial (schema only). 205 tests green. |
| 2026-05-14 | Developer (Phase 1) | Implemented Phase-1 Core Schema | 30 files: 7 migrations, 7 models, 5 enums, 2 services (PayoutService preserved, RevenueService new), 7 factories, WorkflowLockedException. All 205 tests green. |

| 2026-05-13 | Planner | Produced blueprint | Phase 1 plan: 7 tables, 7 models, 2 services, 6 enums, 41 ACs. Complexity: Complex. 3 open questions flagged. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tracker | Verified Phase-1 plan | Plan at `docs/plans/phase-1-core-schema-payout.md` confirmed present. Summary: 7 tables (restaurants, bikers, pix_keys, shifts, shift_bikers, payments, payment_audit_logs), 7 Eloquent models with relationships, 6 backed enums, 2 BCMath financial services (PayoutService, RevenueService), 7 factories, 41 acceptance criteria. 3 open questions flagged (auth FK columns, trip-level granularity, shift draft state). BR-01 (workflow locking), BR-03 (payout formula), BR-04 (granular failure), BR-06 (payment retry audit) all addressed in plan. |
| 2026-05-14 | Validator | Audited BR-03 — 🟢 Validated | All 18 tests pass. BCMath scale 2 enforced. Formula matches PRD/BR-03 exactly. No floats in financial path. Negative trips rejection verified. Return type string verified. Decimal precision verified at DECIMAL(12,2) boundary. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tester | Confirmed GREEN — 18/18 tests pass | `tests/Unit/PayoutServiceTest.php`: 18 tests (AC-05 through AC-16 + AC-29 + boundary tests), 0 failures, 0 regressions. BCMath precision verified. |
| 2026-05-14 | Developer | Implemented PayoutService | `app/Services/PayoutService.php` — `calculate(baseFee, bikerRate, tripsCount): string`. BCMath bcmul/bcadd with scale 2. Zero-trip guard. InvalidArgumentException for negative trips. |
| 2026-05-14 | Tester | Tests RED — 18 failing tests written | `tests/Unit/PayoutServiceTest.php` — 18 unit tests covering AC-05→AC-16, AC-29, boundary tests. All fail (PayoutService does not exist yet). |
| 2026-05-14 | Planner | Produced BR-03 blueprint | `docs/plans/BR-03-payout-formula.md` — PayoutService with calculate(), 18+ acceptance criteria, BCMath scale 2, migration for shift_bikers inputs. |
| 2026-05-13 | Orchestrator | Created progress board | Initial setup with TDD pipeline |
